      <h1>The Lion and the Boar</h1>

      <p>A Mouse, by an unlucky chance, formed an intimate acquaintance with a
Frog. The Frog one day, intent on mischief, bound the foot of the Mouse
tightly to his own. Thus joined together, the Frog led his friend toward
the pool in which he lived, until he reached the very brink, when
suddenly jumping in, he dragged the Mouse in with him. The Frog enjoyed
the water amazingly, and swam croaking about as if he had done a
meritorious action. The unhappy Mouse was soon suffocated with the
water, and his dead body floated about on the surface, tied to the foot
of the Frog. A Hawk observed it, and, pouncing upon it, carried it up
aloft. The Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also
carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk.</p>

        <h1>The Dog and the Oyster</h1>

      <p>A Dog, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster, and opening his mouth to its
widest extent, swallowed it down with the utmost relish, supposing it to
be an egg. Soon afterwards suffering great pain in his stomach, he said:
"I deserve all this torment, for my folly in thinking that everything
round must be an egg."</p>

        <h1>The Lion and the Boar</h1>

      <p>On a summer day, when the great heat induced a general thirst, a Lion
and a Boar came at the same moment to a small well to drink. They
fiercely disputed which of them should drink first, and were soon
engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat. On their stopping on a
sudden to take breath for the fiercer renewal of the strife, they saw
some Vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one which should
fall first. They at once made up their quarrel, saying: "It is better
for us to make friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures, as
will certainly happen if we are disabled."</p>

<p class="conclusion">Those who strive are often watched by others who will take advantage of
their defeat to benefit themselves.</p>
